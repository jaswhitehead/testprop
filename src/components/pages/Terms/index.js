                information in connection to your account, or trade on the name or reputation of others,

            <h3>2. Responsibility of Users of the Website, Products, and/or Services</h3>
            <p>Your access to, and all of your use of the Website, Products, and/or Services must be lawful and must be 
                in compliance with these Terms, and any other agreement between you and PropUp.

                <br />• Engaging in conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, giving rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any city, state, national or international law or regulation that would fail to comply with accepted internet protocol;
                <br />• Communicating, transmitting, or posting material that is copyrighted or otherwise owned by a third party unless you are the copyright owner or have the permission of the owner to post it;

                <br />• Communicating, transmitting, or posting material that infringes on any other intellectual property, privacy or publicity right of another;
                <br />• Attempting to interfere in any way with the Website, or our networks or network security, or attempting to use our Website to gain unauthorized access to any other computer system;
                <br />• Accessing data not intended for you, or logging on to a server or account, which you are not authorized to access;
                <br />• Attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization (or succeeding in such an attempt);
                <br />• Attempting to interfere or interfering with the operation of the Website, Products, and/or Services, or our provision of Services to any other users of the Website, our hosting provider or our network, including, without limitation, via means of submitting a virus to the Website, overloading, “flooding”, “mail bombing” or “crashing” the Website.

That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:
                <br />• the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
            </p><br></br>
            <h3>3. Fees and Payments</h3>
            <p>By purchasing Products and/or Services, you agree to pay PropUp annual subscription fees indicated 
                for such Product or Service. Payments will be due as of the first day you sign up for a Product and/or 
                Services, and will cover an annual period, as indicated when signing up.<br></br><br></br>
                Configurations and prices of the Website, Products, and/or Services are subject to change at any time, 
                and PropUp shall at all times be entitled to modify configurations, fees, prices and quotations, 
                provided that no price changes shall be made applicable to you during a subscription term, and shall 
                only take effect after PropUp and you have agreed upon an extension, upgrade or renewal of the 
                subscription term. You agree to any such changes if you do not object in writing to PropUp within 
                seven (7) business days of receiving a notice of PropUp, or an invoice, incorporating or announcing 
                the fee and/or price changes. All prices are exclusive of, and you shall pay all taxes, duties, levies 
                or fees, or other similar charges imposed on PropUp or yourself by any taxing authority (other than 
                taxes imposed on PropUp’s income), related to your order, unless you have provided PropUp with 
                an appropriate resale or exemption certificate for the delivery location, which is the location where 
                the Products and/or Services are used or performed. In case of changes in law such that a tax is levied 
                that is or becomes irrecoverable with a consequent increase to the costs to PropUp of delivering the 
                Products and/or Services, whereby and to such an extent PropUp is entitled to increase its prices 
                accordingly and retroactively. 
            </p><br></br>
            <h3>4. Copyright Infringement</h3>  
            <p>
                As PropUp requires others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual 
                property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by the Website violates 
                your copyright, you are encouraged to notify PropUp. PropUp will, as it is able, respond to all 
                such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling 
                all links to the infringing material. In order to bring infringing material to our attention, you must 
                provide our DMCA Agent with the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the 
                person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyrighted work; (b) an identification of the 
                copyrighted work and the location on the Website of the allegedly infringing work; (c) a written 
                statement that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the owner, 
                its agent or the law; (d) your name and contact information, including telephone number and email 
                address; and (e) a statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and, under 
                penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
            </p><br></br>
